# JavaScript/HTML/CSS projects

This repository contains personal projects for learning in JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Just by the titles of the projects, its obvious what it is, but as the summer goes on I will be working on larger projects that requires a description inside this README file. Feel free to download and run these projects! :)
