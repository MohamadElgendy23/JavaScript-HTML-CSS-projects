# JavaScript/HTML/CSS projects

This repository contains personal projects for learning and improving skills in JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Just by the titles of the projects, its obvious what it is, but as the summer goes on I will be working on larger projects that requires a description inside this README file. Feel free to download and run these projects! :)

Simple (semi) Projects:
> Calculator: 
  > Nice looking UI with buttons handled by event listeners. 
  > The calculator handles repeating operations. For example: 2+3*6. The 2+3 is calculated on the fly => 2+3 = 5 * 6 = 30. (No PEMDAS here because 2+3 is added first in the calculator).
